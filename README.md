**A Personal Project by Abhiram**

## **Project Overview**  
This is a **personal landing page** for my YouTube channel, **Nature Studio**, which showcases AI-generated nature visuals and ambient loops designed for relaxation, meditation, and creative inspiration. The page serves as a central hub for visitors to explore the channel and connect via social media.  

Built with **HTML5** and **CSS3**, this project reflects my interest in web development and digital content creation.
